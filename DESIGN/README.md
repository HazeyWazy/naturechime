# NatureChime

## _"Capture the world, one sound at a time."_

NatureChime is a mobile application designed to help users discover, record, and catalog the diverse audio environments that surround us daily. From the gentle rustling of leaves in a forest to the rhythmic clatter of a passing train, our world is filled with distinctive sounds that often go unnoticed or undocumented. NatureChime aims to change that by giving users an intuitive platform to capture these audio moments, build personal sound libraries, and share their discoveries with others.

Unlike traditional audio recording apps that focus on voice memos or music creation, NatureChime is specifically tailored for environmental sound collection. Whether you're a nature enthusiast documenting bird calls, an urban explorer mapping city soundscapes, or simply someone who appreciates unique audio experiences, NatureChime provides the tools to build your own personal audio archive of environmental sounds.
