# NatureChime

## _"Capture the world, one sound at a time."_

NatureChime is a mobile application designed to help users discover, record, and catalog the diverse audio environments that surround us daily. From the gentle rustling of leaves in a forest to the rhythmic clatter of a passing train, our world is filled with distinctive sounds that often go unnoticed or undocumented. NatureChime lets users capture these audio moments, and build personal sound libraries.

Unlike traditional audio recording apps that focus on voice memos or music creation, NatureChime is specifically designed for environmental sound collection. Whether you're a nature enthusiast documenting bird calls, an urban explorer mapping city soundscapes, or someone who simply appreciates unique audio experiences, NatureChime provides the tools to create a personal archive of environmental sounds.
